<!-- PR body becomes release notes. Write for users, not reviewers. -->

- **Feature/fix name** - One sentence describing the user-visible change
- **Another change** - Keep it brief, focus on what users get

<!--
Tips:
- Use bullet points (they render nicely in release notes)
- Start each bullet with what changed, not how
- Skip implementation details unless they affect usage
- If it's a bugfix, describe what works now (not what was broken)
-->
